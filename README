Usage
-----

Do this:

  #define GAME_OF_LIFE_IMPLEMENTATION

before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
implementation.

i.e. it should look like this:

  #include ...
  #include ...
  #include ...
  #define GAME_OF_LIFE_IMPLEMENTATION
  #include "game-of-life.h"

If you want basic printing functionality from this library, you
need to #define GAME_OF_LIFE_PRINT

To run a simultation, simply call `game_of_life_simulate`.

Check out the `example.c` file for a complete example.
